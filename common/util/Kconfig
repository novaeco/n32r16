            Selecting this option appends "-fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage" to the
            compilation and linking flags for all common components. Enable it in
            CI or dedicated coverage builds alongside project-specific coverage
            options before executing unit tests so that gcov artefacts are
            generated for aggregation by tools/run_coverage.py.
